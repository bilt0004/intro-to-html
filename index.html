            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <img src="/images/biltzs2023.jpg" width="400" alt="">

            <p>Iâ€™m Shiraz Biltz, I was born in Israel and I am half Romanian, half Georgian. Unsurprisingly, I had traveled a lot from a very young age to visit my extended family. Travel had played a big part in my interest in photography, but I also became intrigued with art in general, and explored many different mediums. Today, my hobbies include embroidery, photography, video games, seeing friends, travel, and learning about anything and everything.</p>

            <p>Even before I completed the photography program at Algonquin College, I knew I wanted to keep learning. After two years working in a photography studio, I ended up going back to take the graphic design program as well. My parents have told me to stop learning and to go join the workforce again, but I have thought about getting a bachelor's as well. Truly a nightmare child, picking two very expensive art programs, and possessing an unavoidable urge to keep learning.</p>
